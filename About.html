                <p>
                    Haukai Restaurant specialises in Māori kai and is based in the Bay of Islands. 
                    It was started by a couple who are keen on creating a business that would appeal to locals and tourists visiting the area.
                    The dinner menu features Māori and Pākeha kai options and drinks. 
                    HAUKAI also want customers to experience Te Ao Māori with the use of karakia for blessing food and other Māori culture through the food experience.
